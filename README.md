# All-in-One-AutoCare
This is a project for cars management system, it provides services like selling, renting, cleaning and repair for cars. 
## Project description 
This project will be built with Python since it's simple and easy to adapt with and also because I never built a management system with python eventhough I used it alot which will be interesting for me, the project database will be SQLite rather than MySQL or MSSQL that I am familiar with. The project will be based on command-line interface but if plenty time is left I will add GUI using Tkinter.
